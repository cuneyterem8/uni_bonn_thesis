Improving Letâ€™s Hash: Development of a website helping developers with security-related programming tasks

Password security has always been a significant issue for software developers and users. At
first glance, it may seem that software developers care a lot about security. However, many
studies have shown that software developers should be at least as careful as users due to
a lack of security concerns. For this reason, different infrastructures have been developed
to support software developers in many fields. One example is the LetsHashSalt website, a
platform that allows software developers to write more secure password authentication. The
primary purpose of this thesis is to expand the features of the LetsHashSalt website, make it
appealing to more programmers, and help them to write secure password authentication codes
in different languages. That is why we added new programming languages to the website, such
as Javascript, PHP, Golang, C# languages, and libraries like Pbkdf2 and Regex. In addition, we
asked five professional software developers who are experts in their fields to test the security of
the code blocks. Finally, we made it a more comprehensive, secure password authentication
website that many software developers can use.
